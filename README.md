### Description of `O*NET` from US government: 

The `O*NET` database includes information on skills, abilities, knowledges, work activities, and interests associated with occupations. This information can be used to facilitate career exploration, vocational counseling, and a variety of human resources functions, such as developing job orders and position descriptions and aligning training with current workplace needs.

Information in `O*NET` is available for over 900 occupations. 
Each occupational title and code is based on the 2010 version of the Standard Occupational Classification system.


the `O*NET` database, containing information on hundreds of standardized and occupation-specific descriptors. The database is continually updated by surveying a broad range of workers from each occupation. Information from this freely available database forms the heart of `O*NET` OnLine, the interactive application for exploring and searching occupations. The database also provides the basis for our Career Exploration Tools, a set of valuable assessment instruments for workers and students looking to find or change careers. Every occupation requires a different mix of knowledge, skills, and abilities, and is performed using a variety of activities and tasks. These distinguishing characteristics of an occupation are described by the `O*NET` Content Model, which encapsulates the key features of an occupation into a standardized, measurable set of variables called "descriptors". The hierarchical model starts with six domains, describing the day-to-day aspects of the job and the qualifications and interests of the typical worker. The model expands to 277 descriptors collected by the `O*NET` program (...)*
